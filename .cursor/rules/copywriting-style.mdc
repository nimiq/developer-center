# Copywriting Style Guide – Nimiq Developer Center

This rule defines **mandatory copywriting conventions** that apply to *every* documentation page, example, or UI text in the Nimiq Developer Center. Follow these guidelines in addition to broader [documentation authoring](mdc:.cursor/rules/documentation-authoring.mdc) rules.

> **Related Rules**: This style guide works with [documentation authoring](mdc:.cursor/rules/documentation-authoring.mdc) for structure, [personas](mdc:.cursor/rules/personas.mdc) for audience understanding, and the [Nimiq theme](mdc:.cursor/rules/nimiq-vitepress-theme.mdc) for implementation.

---

## 1. Voice & Tone
1. **Direct and Conversational** – Address the reader as *you*. Use *we* sparingly to indicate collective action.
2. **Active Voice, Present Tense** – "Run the command" not "The command should be run".
3. **Confident, Not Over-Selling** – State capabilities plainly; avoid hype words like *revolutionary* or *game-changing*.
4. **Inclusive Language** – Use gender-neutral pronouns and avoid idioms that may not translate culturally.

## 2. Clarity & Brevity
- Prefer short sentences (< 20 words) and single-idea paragraphs.
- Delete filler phrases such as *simply*, *actually*, *basically*.
- Explain acronyms on first use: "Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)".

## 3. Terminology Consistency
- Use terms exactly as defined in the glossary; do not invent synonyms (e.g., always **validator**, never *minter*).
- Capitalize protocol components (e.g., **Albatross**, **Nimiq Node**) but keep generic nouns lowercase.

## 4. Formatting Conventions
| Element           | Style                                                                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Headings          | Sentence case (`## Send a transaction`)                                         |
| Inline code       | Backticks `like_this`                                                           |
| File paths        | Italic monospace *`/home/user/nimiq.conf`*                                      |
| Buttons / UI text | **Bold**                                                                        |
| Placeholders      | `<angle-brackets>`                                                              |

## 5. Content Structure Patterns
> **For complete document structure**: See [documentation authoring](mdc:.cursor/rules/documentation-authoring.mdc)

1. **Context → Action → Result**
   - *Context*: "You have a running node."
   - *Action*: "Run `nimiq --status`"
   - *Result*: "You see the current block height and peer count."
2. Place the most common path first; move edge-cases to a **Troubleshooting** or **Advanced** subsection.

## 6. Callouts & Alerts
- `> Note:` for supplementary information.
- `> Tip:` for best practices.
- `> Warning:` for risk of data loss or security issues.

## 7. Technical Content Guidelines
- Use SI units; add non-SI only in parentheses if helpful.
- For block heights, include both decimal and hex when relevant.
- Use the Oxford comma.
- Use en-dashes (–) for ranges, em-dashes (—) sparingly for breaks.
- Do **not** use "&" unless part of an official name.

## 8. Integration with Theme Elements
> **For technical implementation**: See [Nimiq VitePress theme](mdc:.cursor/rules/nimiq-vitepress-theme.mdc)

When writing content that uses theme components:
- Use `.nq-subline` class for subtitles: ``
- Reference icons properly: see [icon usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/icons-usage.mdc)
- Follow [fluid spacing](mdc:.cursor/rules/fluid-spacing.mdc) patterns in examples

## 9. Quality Checklist
Before finalising any copy:
- [ ] Sentences are active, present tense.
- [ ] Acronyms explained on first occurrence.
- [ ] Terminology matches glossary.
- [ ] No filler words.
- [ ] Headings follow sentence case.
- [ ] Content structure follows [documentation authoring](mdc:.cursor/rules/documentation-authoring.mdc) patterns.
- [ ] Target [persona](mdc:.cursor/rules/personas.mdc) can achieve goals quickly.
