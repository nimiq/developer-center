## Nimiq: the Blockchain for JS Devs!

Nimiq is the first browser blockchain. That means apps based on Nimiq can run directly in the browser of the user, locally, installation-free, without the need of a server-side application. And if you have a server-side application, you can use the Nimiq Node.js client. This way, it can be easily integrated into any existing app. Syncing with Nimiq requires seconds, not hours and it works on low-bandwidth. Ideal for mobile and progressive web-apps.

- You can create blockchain-enabled applications in JS without a third party to rely on
- No dependencies on external services, your app is a full member of the Nimiq network
- No service fees, terms of use, rules, and restrictions
- Everything open source and licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0 license
- Create a blockchain powered app and deploy it, or
- Add NIM payments to any existing app
