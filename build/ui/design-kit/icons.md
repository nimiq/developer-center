Working on it at the moment

### Copy per Icon

You can copy the icon as SVG to paste in almost any editor (Figma, Sketch, Illustrator, etc.), or copy as component to use in your web apps. You can also visit the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/iyfVJafk18HfrYLXukpf0n/Nimiq-Icons?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=aQtR0IBpAeUwyBho-0) to see all the icons and copy them to your own project.

### Iconify Runtime

Iconify provides a runtime solution that fetches icons on the go. Refer its [documentation](https://iconify.design/) for more details.

### Atomic CSS

Created by the author of Icônes. With the power of [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss), you can use the icons with Pure CSS using `@unocss/preset-icons`.

Check out this [blog post](https://antfu.me/posts/icons-in-pure-css) for more.

### Components

Created by the author of Icônes, [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons) is a on-demand solution to generate icons as components on the fly.

Check out [this blog](https://antfu.me/posts/journey-with-icons-continues) post for the story behind.
